# Welcome!

This repository contains the work done by Lowell Monis for Dr. Nathan Haut's CMSE 202 at Michigan State University during the Fall Semester of 2024.

## Quick Guide

In this repository, the homework assignments and exams completed for this course are in individual directories. You will find the notebook containing the homework assignment, associated data sets, and output files like GIFs in each of these directories.

There is also a directory (`Day-13`) that contains an in-class assignment completed that includes a revision of regression.
